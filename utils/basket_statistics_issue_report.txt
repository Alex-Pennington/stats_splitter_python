FIREWOOD SPLITTER PRODUCTION MONITORING SYSTEM
BASKET STATISTICS ISSUE ANALYSIS REPORT
================================================================================

Date: 2025-10-13
System Export Time: 14:16:29
Analysis Performed: Post-production data review

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
The production monitoring system recorded 10 completed baskets instead of the 
expected 9 baskets due to duplicate basket completion signals occurring within 
milliseconds of each other. This indicates either operator error (double-
clicking) or a technical issue with the HTTP API handling.

================================================================================
ISSUE DETAILS
================================================================================

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
• System reports: 10 completed baskets
• Expected count: 9 baskets (user reported)
• Discrepancy: +1 basket (extra basket recorded)

ROOT CAUSE:
Rapid successive basket completion signals with gaps of 12.9ms to 69.5ms 
between basket completion and next basket start times. This is physically 
impossible for manual operations and indicates duplicate HTTP API calls.

EVIDENCE:
1. Timing Analysis Results:
   - 8 out of 9 basket transitions show suspicious timing (88.9% rate)
   - Shortest gap: 12.9ms between baskets 2->3
   - Longest suspicious gap: 69.5ms between baskets 9->10
   - Only 1 transition (basket 7->8) shows normal timing (166.5ms)

2. Basket Duration Analysis:
   - Basket #2: Only 3.6 minutes duration with 7 splits
   - This is abnormally short and likely a phantom basket
   - Normal baskets range from 26-48 minutes

3. Split Count Verification:
   - Calculated splits from baskets: 792
   - System reported splits: 791
   - Difference: -1 split (minor accounting discrepancy)

TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
================================================================================

SYSTEM BEHAVIOR:
• HTTP API endpoint: /api/production/complete-basket
• Duplicate calls processed successfully without deduplication
• No rate limiting or duplicate detection implemented
• Each call creates a new basket record regardless of timing

LIKELY SCENARIOS:
1. Operator double-clicked "Complete Basket" button (most likely)
2. Network timeout caused automatic retry of HTTP request
3. Browser/device sent duplicate requests due to connectivity issues
4. Race condition in web interface JavaScript code

IMPACT ASSESSMENT:
• Data integrity: Moderate impact (inflated basket count)
• Production metrics: Slightly skewed but still usable
• Fuel consumption tracking: Accurate (tied to actual usage)
• Split count tracking: Accurate (tied to actual production cycles)

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
1. Implement request deduplication in /api/production/complete-basket endpoint
2. Add client-side button debouncing (prevent rapid clicks)
3. Add confirmation dialog for basket completion
4. Implement rate limiting (max 1 basket completion per 5 seconds)

MEDIUM-TERM IMPROVEMENTS:
1. Add basket completion validation logic:
   - Minimum basket duration (e.g., 15 minutes)
   - Minimum split count before completion allowed
   - Time gap validation between completions

2. Enhanced logging:
   - Log all basket completion requests with timestamps
   - Track source IP and user agent for duplicate detection
   - Add audit trail for basket operations

LONG-TERM CONSIDERATIONS:
1. Implement automatic basket completion based on split count thresholds
2. Add undo functionality for accidentally completed baskets
3. Implement data correction tools for historical anomalies

================================================================================
DATA CORRECTION APPROACH
================================================================================

FOR THIS SPECIFIC DATASET:
The most likely phantom basket is #2 (3.6 minutes, 7 splits) as it shows:
- Abnormally short duration
- Low split count
- Immediate timing after basket #1 completion

MANUAL CORRECTION WOULD INVOLVE:
1. Remove basket #2 from completed_baskets array
2. Merge basket #2's 7 splits into basket #1 or #3
3. Adjust subsequent basket numbers (3->2, 4->3, etc.)
4. Recalculate cumulative statistics

However, since the core production data (splits, cycles, fuel) is accurate,
the statistical impact is minimal and correction may not be necessary.

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

The basket counting discrepancy is caused by duplicate HTTP API calls resulting
in phantom basket records. While this affects the basket count accuracy, the
core production metrics (splits, fuel consumption, cycle counts) remain reliable
as they are tracked independently of basket completion signals.

The issue can be prevented in future operations through implementation of
request deduplication and user interface improvements to prevent accidental
duplicate submissions.
