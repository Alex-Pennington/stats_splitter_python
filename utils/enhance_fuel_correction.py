Enhanced Fuel Correction Tool

Since the production reference also shows missing fuel data for baskets 2&3,
we need to:
1. Recognize that 5 gallons total was used during the day
2. Estimate and redistribute the missing 1.29 gallons to baskets 2&3
3. Base the distribution on operational time and splits completed
